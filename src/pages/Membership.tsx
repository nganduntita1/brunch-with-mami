                This is more than just a membership â€” itâ€™s a promise to yourself. A promise to nurture your body, mind, and spirit while surrounding yourself with women who uplift and inspire.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                Every yoga session, care package, and exclusive event is designed with you in mind â€” to remind you that you are worthy of rest, growth, and joy. Together, weâ€™re creating a sisterhood where women donâ€™t just come to network, but to heal, to learn, and to rise â€” side by side.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                By joining, you become part of a community that sees you, values you, and walks with you as you write your own story of success. ðŸ’«
